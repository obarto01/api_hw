		<h2> API Description </h2>
		<div id="descrip">
			The API that I used was a list of all active Major Leage Baseball players, with details on each player's background. This includes information
			about the position they might play, where they were born, or the college that they attended. It also provides the individual ID of each player
			from different gambling and fantasy baseball sites. The premium version of this API could also provide accurate statistics for each player.
		</div>
		<h2> Website </h2>
		<div id="site">
			The website is called sportsdata.io, and provides all different sorts of information and statistics on the 
			major professional sports leagues in the US. This includes box scores from past games, statistics and background of individual players, 
			and different types of team data. In particular, I used the site's Major Leage Baseball features to look into the backgrounds of 
			individual players, for instance, Aaron Judge's hometown. It seems like the site is primarily used for fantasy sports, which makes 
			heavy use of statistics.			
		</div>
		<h2> Options </h2>
		<div id="options">
			There were a variety of options to choose from in this API, and I used the BirthCity and BirthState options in my request. Since the players
			are arranged in a JSON array, I also had to find Aaron Judge's index in the array to get the appropriate hometown. I liked this feature because
			I think it is interesting to look at the demographic backgrounds of professional athletes and look for trends in that way.		
		</div>
		<h2> Helpful Applications </h2>
		<div id="applications">
			There are many ways this API could be used as a practical tool. If someone wanted to generate a list of players that played at a particular college,
			they could easily do so by sorting through the JSON Players object. I think it could also be a useful tool for the management side of baseball teams. If 
			a GM were looking to acquire a player at a certain position, or a player who is younger than 30, the options in this API could help them narrow down their 
			search. Basically, this API compiles a bunch of useful information on each player into one place, which makes it a useful tool.
